It includes a range of behaviours from harmful use to dependence and affects individuals using both prescription opioids and illegal substances like heroin. Treatment is multifaceted, typically involving a combination of medication-assisted treatment (MAT), detoxification, long-term maintenance therapy, and comprehensive psychosocial support.",
