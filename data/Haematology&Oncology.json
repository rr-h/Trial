    "Summary": "Testicular cancer is the most common malignancy in young adult men (20 to 34 years), characterized by a hard, painless nodule on one testis. It is highly curable when diagnosed early, with a specific precancerous condition called carcinoma in situ. Ultrasound is 90%-95% accurate in diagnosis, and initial treatment usually involves radical orchiectomy. A complication of surgery can be infertility.",
    "Symptoms": "Hard, painless nodule on one testis, non-specific testicular discomfort, swelling (possibly painful due to haemorrhage or infection)",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis involves considering any intratesticular mass as testicular cancer until proven otherwise. Key diagnostic methods include ultrasound of the testis, serum tumour markers (beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin, alpha-fetoprotein, lactate dehydrogenase), and histological examination post-orchiectomy. CT scan and MRI are used for staging.",

Early-stage non-seminoma: Surveillance, chemotherapy, or retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) after orchiectomy. The treatment approach depends on specific patient and cancer features.",
    "UrgentConsiderations": "Early diagnosis is crucial for a better long-term prognosis. Any growth of the testis should be regarded as malignant and managed accordingly.",
