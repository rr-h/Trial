    "Summary": "Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease primarily affecting the lungs, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It's crucial to recognize and treat infectious TB early to prevent transmission. Key risk factors include exposure to the infection, being born in an endemic country, and HIV infection.",
    "Symptoms": "Cough, fever, weight loss, malaise, pleuritic chest pain, night sweats, hemoptysis, psychological symptoms, clubbing, erythema nodosum",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis involves a high level of suspicion in patients with risk factors. It is confirmed by culturing Mycobacterium tuberculosis from sputum samples and chest x-ray. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear, nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT), and full blood count are used in diagnostics. Empirical treatment may be started based on clinical suspicion before laboratory confirmation.",
    "Treatments": "Treatment includes an initial intensive phase and a subsequent continuation phase. Directly observed therapy (DOT) is recommended to ensure adherence. WHO guidelines suggest a standard 6-month treatment regimen for new patients.",
    "UrgentConsiderations": "Early recognition and treatment are vital to prevent transmission. If TB is suspected, patient isolation is recommended.",
    "RedFlags": "Critical symptoms like extensive coughing, severe weight loss, and hemoptysis require immediate medical attention.",
    "Medications": "Initial intensive regimen: Isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol. Continuation phase: Isoniazid and rifampicin.",
    "ReferralPathways": "Referral to infectious disease specialists or pulmonologists is recommended for complex cases or treatment non-adherence.",
    "Referral Template": "Referral should include patient's medical history, symptoms, diagnostic test results, and any treatment already initiated.",
