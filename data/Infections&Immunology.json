    "Classification": "Bacterial Infection",
    "Summary": "Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It progresses through several stages: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary. Early stages are characterized by sores and rashes, while later stages can lead to serious damage to the heart, brain, and other organs.",
    "Symptoms": "Primary stage: single or multiple painless ulcers (chancres). Secondary stage: skin rash, mucosal lesions, lymphadenopathy. Latent stage: asymptomatic. Tertiary stage: gummas, neurological or cardiovascular symptoms.",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosed through serological tests including non-treponemal tests (RPR, VDRL) and treponemal tests (FTA-ABS, EIA). Darkfield microscopy and PCR can also be used.",
    "Treatments": "Antibiotic therapy with penicillin. In early syphilis, benzathine benzylpenicillin is used. In late syphilis or neurosyphilis, aqueous crystalline penicillin G or procaine penicillin with probenecid is recommended.",
    "UrgentConsiderations": "Prompt treatment is crucial to prevent progression to late stages. Pregnant women should be treated to prevent congenital syphilis. Neurosyphilis requires immediate medical attention.",
    "RedFlags": "Neurological symptoms, signs of aortic aneurysm, or gummas.",
    "Medications": "Benzathine benzylpenicillin, aqueous crystalline penicillin G, procaine penicillin, probenecid.",
    "ReferralPathways": "Referral to a specialist for complicated cases or for pregnant women. Sexual partners should also be referred for evaluation.",
