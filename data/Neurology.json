    "Summary": "Febrile seizures, usually self-limiting, occur in febrile children aged 6 to 60 months without intracranial infection, metabolic disturbance, or history of afebrile seizures. Most febrile seizures resolve spontaneously and quickly, not requiring acute or long-term anticonvulsant treatment.",
    "Symptoms": "Seizure in a febrile child, often with loss of consciousness and generalised clonic movements or tonic stiffening. Simple febrile seizures are short (usually less than 15 minutes), resolving spontaneously without recurrence in 24 hours. Complex febrile seizures may have focal onset, prolonged duration, or recurrence.",
    "Diagnosis": "Clinical assessment is key. Simple febrile seizures typically don't require further evaluation. However, lumbar puncture may be needed to rule out meningitis or encephalitis, especially in infants under 6 months or in cases of complex febrile seizures.",
    "Treatments": "Treatment focuses on seizure control, reducing body temperature, and relieving discomfort. Antipyretic agents are commonly used but ineffective in preventing seizure recurrence. Anticonvulsant therapy is usually not needed. In complex cases, further evaluation and treatment may be required.",

    "Classification": "Neurodegenerative disorder",
    "Summary": "Vascular dementia is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment, predominantly from cerebrovascular causes like infarction and small-vessel changes. It often affects executive functions more than memory. It's the second most common cause of dementia, with significant overlap with Alzheimer's dementia.",

Slowing of gait, shuffling, feet 'stuck to the floor', increasing loss of balance, falls, and incontinence.",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis involves cognitive testing to detect multiple cognitive domain impairments. Brain imaging (CT or MRI) is important for diagnosis to detect infarcts and assess white matter lesions.",
    "Treatments": "Focus on safety, reassurance, and support. Prevent further cerebrovascular disease by controlling risk factors. Use of antiplatelet therapy, carotid endarterectomy or stenting, anticoagulation, and lifestyle modifications. Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine for mixed dementia cases.",
