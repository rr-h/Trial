    "ConditionName": "Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA)",
    "Classification": "Vasculitis",
    "Summary": "Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) is a common form of vasculitis in individuals aged 50 years or older, predominantly affecting the extracranial branches of the carotid artery. It poses a serious risk of irreversible blindness, aortic aneurysms, and large vessel stenoses. Diagnosis is primarily through temporal artery ultrasonography and/or biopsy. Key symptoms include jaw claudication, diplopia, and abnormal temporal artery. Prednisolone is the primary treatment, with Tocilizumab also used for its therapeutic benefits in GCA treatment&#8203;``\u3010oaicite:4\u3011``&#8203;&#8203;``\u3010oaicite:3\u3011``&#8203;.",
    "Symptoms": "The main symptoms of GCA include frequent, severe headaches, pain or tenderness at the temples or scalp, jaw pain while eating or talking, and vision problems like double vision or vision loss. General symptoms such as flu-like symptoms, unintentional weight loss, depression, and tiredness are also common. Additionally, some people with GCA develop polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), characterized by pain, stiffness, and inflammation in muscles around the shoulders, neck, and hips&#8203;``\u3010oaicite:2\u3011``&#8203;.",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis involves clinical examination of the temples and blood tests, followed by referral to a specialist.

    "ConditionName": "ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)",
    "Classification": "Cardiovascular Disease",
    "Summary": "ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) is a critical condition caused by a complete blockage of a coronary artery, leading to significant damage to the heart muscle. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent heart muscle death. STEMI is characterized by its distinct elevation in the ST segment on an electrocardiogram (ECG). The blockage is usually due to a blood clot forming on top of atherosclerotic plaque in a coronary artery. Immediate treatment focuses on restoring blood flow, typically through percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or, less commonly, thrombolysis.",
    "Symptoms": "The hallmark symptom of STEMI is sudden, severe chest pain, often described as a feeling of pressure, tightness, or squeezing. The pain may radiate to the arms, neck, jaw, back, or stomach. Other symptoms include shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, light-headedness, and palpitations. These symptoms can vary in intensity and may be more subtle in the elderly, women, and people with diabetes.",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of STEMI involves a combination of clinical assessment, electrocardiogram (ECG), and blood tests for cardiac biomarkers. The ECG is crucial, with STEMI typically showing ST-segment elevation. Blood tests measure levels of cardiac biomarkers like troponin, which are released when heart muscle is damaged. The speed of diagnosis is vital to ensure prompt treatment.",
    "Treatments": "The primary treatment for STEMI is rapid reperfusion therapy to restore blood flow to the affected part of the heart. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred method, involving the insertion of a catheter with a balloon to open the blocked artery, often placing a stent. If PCI is not available within a critical time window, thrombolytic therapy, which involves medication to dissolve the clot, may be used. Long-term management includes medications like aspirin, clopidogrel, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins to prevent further cardiac events and manage risk factors.",
    "UrgentConsiderations": "The urgency in treating STEMI arises from the risk of extensive heart damage and potential complications like heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. Rapid intervention to restore coronary blood flow is crucial to minimize heart muscle damage. Patients with suspected STEMI should receive immediate medical attention, and emergency medical services should be activated without delay.",
    "RedFlags": "RedFlags for STEMI include intense, unrelenting chest pain, often with radiation to the arms, neck, or jaw, accompanied by shortness of breath, sweating, and nausea. These symptoms, particularly in patients with known cardiovascular risk factors, require immediate emergency medical evaluation and treatment.",
    "Medications": "Immediate management of STEMI includes aspirin and other antiplatelet agents like clopidogrel or ticagrelor to prevent further clot formation. Beta-blockers reduce heart rate and oxygen demand, ACE inhibitors help in remodeling and improving heart function post-infarction, and statins lower cholesterol levels to reduce atherosclerotic progression. These medications are part of long-term management to prevent recurrent cardiac events.",

Ventricular rates range from 120 to 160 bpm, typically around 150 bpm due to common 2:1 atrioventricular block. It's often associated with atrial fibrillation and may convert between the two.",
    "Symptoms": "Palpitations, dyspnoea, fatigue, light-headedness, chest discomfort, altered consciousness, polyuria, exercise intolerance, worsening heart failure symptoms, features of embolic events like stroke or pulmonary embolism.",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis involves a 12-lead resting ECG showing continuous regular electrical activity, commonly a saw-tooth pattern, and atrial rates above 250 bpm. Additional tests include blood tests (full blood count, thyroid function, renal function, electrolytes, high-sensitivity troponin, digitalis levels), chest x-ray, transthoracic echocardiography, electrophysiological studies, atrial electrogram, exercise tolerance testing, and myocardial ischaemia testing.",
    "Treatments": "Emergency electrical cardioversion for haemodynamically unstable patients; rate control or rhythm control strategies using electrical or pharmacological cardioversion for stable patients. Treatment aims to restore sinus rhythm; rate control drugs often ineffective. Consider long-term rhythm control strategy and treatment of underlying causes. Catheter ablation and drug treatment as secondary options.",

Assessment of vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, is essential. Additionally, assess for any signs of hemodynamic instability, such as hypotension or altered mental status. An ECG should be performed promptly to confirm the diagnosis of atrial flutter. Blood tests, including a complete blood count, thyroid function, and electrolyte levels, can help identify potential underlying causes or contributing factors. Imaging studies like chest x-rays and echocardiography provide valuable information about cardiac structure and function. Finally, consider consultation with a cardiologist or electrophysiologist for further evaluation and management recommendations."
