    "ConditionName": "Thyroid Dysfunction",
    "Classification": "Endocrine Disorder",
    "Summary": "Thyroid dysfunction encompasses a range of disorders affecting thyroid hormone production and regulation. Hypothyroidism results from inadequate production of thyroid hormones, leading to a slowing of bodily functions. Hyperthyroidism, on the other hand, involves overproduction of these hormones, causing acceleration of metabolic processes. Both conditions can have significant physiological and metabolic impacts.",
    "Symptoms": "Hypothyroidism symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, and dry skin. Hyperthyroidism symptoms include weight loss, anxiety, tremors, palpitations, heat intolerance, and increased appetite.",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis involves measuring serum TSH and thyroid hormone levels (free T4 and T3). Additional tests may include thyroid autoantibodies, thyroid ultrasound, and RAIU to evaluate thyroid function and structure.",
    "Treatments": "Hypothyroidism is treated with thyroid hormone replacement, typically levothyroxine. Hyperthyroidism management includes antithyroid medications, radioactive iodine therapy, or thyroidectomy, depending on the cause and severity.",
    "UrgentConsiderations": "Thyroid storm in hyperthyroidism and myxedema coma in hypothyroidism are life-threatening emergencies requiring immediate medical intervention.",
    "RedFlags": "Rapid heart rate, severe fatigue, extreme weight changes, prominent neck swelling, or signs of thyroid eye disease.",
    "Medications": "Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism; methimazole, propylthiouracil, and beta-blockers for hyperthyroidism.",
    "ReferralPathways": "Referral to an endocrinologist is recommended for complex cases or when initial management is unsuccessful.",

    "ConditionName": "Primary Hypothyroidism",
    "Classification": "Endocrine disorder",
    "Summary": "Primary hypothyroidism is a common condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. It leads to a general slowdown of the body's metabolic processes. The most common cause is autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis). It presents with symptoms that are often subtle and nonspecific.",
    "Symptoms": "Symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin, hair loss, muscle weakness, and menstrual irregularities in women.",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is based on elevated TSH levels and low free T4 levels. Thyroid autoantibodies are tested to confirm Hashimoto's thyroiditis. A comprehensive assessment includes evaluating for other autoimmune diseases.",
    "Treatments": "Treatment consists of thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine. The dose is individualized based on age, weight, severity of hypothyroidism, and the presence of comorbid conditions.",
    "UrgentConsiderations": "Severe untreated hypothyroidism can lead to myxedema coma, a rare but life-threatening condition.",
    "RedFlags": "Severe fatigue, unexplained weight gain, and changes in mental status should prompt evaluation for hypothyroidism.",
    "Medications": "Levothyroxine is the primary medication. Dosage adjustments are guided by regular monitoring of TSH and T4 levels.",

    "ConditionName": "Central Hypothyroidism",
    "Classification": "Endocrine disorder",
    "Summary": "Central hypothyroidism is a rare form of hypothyroidism caused by insufficient stimulation of the thyroid gland due to a lack of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary gland or thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. It is often associated with other pituitary hormone deficiencies.",
