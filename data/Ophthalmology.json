    "ConditionName": "Cataracts",
    "Classification": "Lens opacification",
    "Summary": "Cataracts, the most common cause of curable blindness worldwide, particularly affect those aged 50 or over. They are characterized by a decrease in visual acuity due to the opacification of the crystalline lens, often requiring surgical intervention. Cataracts can be caused by aging, ocular trauma, certain medical conditions like diabetes, genetic diseases, and exposure to UV radiation. Treatment involves surgical removal of the opacified lens and usually replacing it with an artificial lens. Post-operative care may include correction of residual refractive error.",
    "Symptoms": "Blurred or cloudy vision, gradual decrease in vision over many years, difficulty with night driving due to glare, changes in color perception, particularly blues, and inadequate glasses prescription in progressing nuclear sclerotic cataracts.",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis involves detecting lens opacity using slit lamp examination or observing opacities in the lens through defects in the red reflex during direct ophthalmoscopy. Risk factors like age, diabetes, long-term use of ocular corticosteroids, family history of congenital cataract, smoking, and UV light exposure are considered.",
    "Treatments": "Surgical removal of the opacified lens, typically replaced by an artificial intra-ocular lens (IOL). Various types of IOLs like toric, multi-focal, and accommodating IOLs are used based on the patient's need. In developing countries, manual small incision cataract surgery or extra-capsular cataract surgery is common, with low-cost IOLs becoming increasingly available.",
    "UrgentConsiderations": "Severe vision impairment requiring prompt surgical intervention.",
    "RedFlags": "Rapid progression of symptoms, especially in diabetic patients, and severe visual impairment indicating the need for urgent evaluation.",
    "Medications": "not specified",
    "ReferralPathways": "Referral to an ophthalmologist for surgical evaluation and management, especially in cases with significant vision impairment or other ocular diseases.",

    "Summary": "Blepharitis, a significant cause of ocular discomfort, is characterized by foreign body sensation, burning, itching, and crusting around eyelashes. It includes lid erythema, collarettes around eyelashes, and capped meibomian glands. Severe cases may lead to corneal changes and visual impairment. Causes include bacteria, Demodex mites, and meibomian gland dysfunction. Treatment focuses on maintaining eyelid hygiene, using topical corticosteroids, antibiotics, and antiparasitics. Addressing underlying medical conditions is vital for successful management\u301079\u2020source\u3011.",
    "Symptoms": "Bilateral ocular burning, itching, foreign body sensation, mild photophobia, crusting on the eyelids, redness of lid margins, dry eye symptoms, and possibly decreased vision in severe cases. Chronic disease may show depigmentation of lashes, trichiasis, madarosis, lid margin thickening and ulceration\u301088\u2020source\u3011.",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosed based on history and clinical findings such as bilateral lid erythema, telangiectasias, collarettes around lashes, capped meibomian glands, and conjunctival hyperaemia. Slit lamp examination is essential. Eye swabs are not typically required, but lid biopsy and lid margin culture may be indicated in atypical or unresponsive cases\u301086\u2020source\u3011\u301087\u2020source\u3011.",
    "Treatments": "Initial treatments include eyelid hygiene measures like warm compresses, lid scrubs, and eyelid massage. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and treatment for dry eye disease may be beneficial. Unresponsive cases may require topical antibiotics, corticosteroids, or antiparasitics. Chronic or severe cases might benefit from oral antibiotics like tetracyclines or macrolides.

It can be infectious, caused by microbes like bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses, or non-infectious, resulting from autoimmune diseases, exposure, or radiation. Key risk factors include corneal trauma, contact lens wear, and compromised corneal epithelium. Diagnosis involves history, slit-lamp examination, and corneal scraping cultures. Treatment targets eliminating the causative agent and preserving ocular function, using topical antimicrobials, corticosteroids, analgesics, and in some cases, systemic drugs. Complications can include scarring, perforation, and endophthalmitis.",

Empirical treatment with antibiotics like polymyxin B/trimethoprim or fluoroquinolones, and in severe cases, a combination of fortified antibiotics. Topical antivirals for herpetic keratitis, and antifungals for fungal keratitis. Non-infectious keratitis may require corticosteroids and systemic immunomodulating therapies.",
    "UrgentConsiderations": "Rapid progression, severe inflammation, corneal thinning >50%, and globe perforation requiring emergent surgical intervention.",

A stye, caused by acute infection of eyelid glands (meibomian, Zeis, Moll), is painful and often associated with Staphylococcus aureus or S. epidermidis. Chalazion, resulting from a foreign body reaction to sebum, is a non-infectious, chronic inflammatory condition. Both conditions are more common in adults. Styes and chalazia usually resolve with warm compresses and topical antibiotics, but recurrent chalazia may require more aggressive treatment like excision.",

The most common symptom is diminished visual acuity. Its etiology is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, including family history, myopia, and certain ethnic origins.",
    "Symptoms": "Diminished visual acuity, headache, eye fatigue. Large degrees of astigmatism reduce visual acuity for both near and distance.",
